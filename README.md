# Sorting Algorithms in C

This project implements various sorting algorithms in C. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file and can be tested individually.

## Prerequisites

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Make (optional, for convenience)

## Usage

To compile and run the tests for algorithms, use the following command:

```bash
make run
```

will compile all the files and run the tests for each algorithm.
